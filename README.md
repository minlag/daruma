# Daruma Badge

Inspired by the PCB badges of hacking conventions, this is a piece of reactive art that embodies the relentless spirit of Japanese [Daruma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daruma_doll) figures. It is built entirely upon a printed circuit board, and can be used as a fridge magnet or worn as a pin.

## Motivations

This project is designed to be an example of elegant and instructive open source hardware. It has deliberately simple electronics, with only 16 components, and can be assembled by anyone comfortable with basic SMD soldering. The software is similarly approachable, written entirely in the Arduino IDE and thoroughly commented. It is also powerful and highly polished, featuring ten channel software PWM, a high performance trig approximation algorithm, custom PCB art, and extensive use of MCU peripherals. 

## Build

Compile with the Arduino IDE using [ATTinyCore](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore) and the [arduino-softpwm](https://github.com/Palatis/arduino-softpwm) library.
